The TodoList is a web-based task management application designed to help you stay organized and keep track of your daily tasks. It offers features that allow you to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, the app offers the convenience of maintaining your tasks even after refreshing the page, thanks to local storage.

Features
1. Create, Edit, and Delete Todo Items

[Create]: You can add as many todo items as you want by simply entering the task name and it's description by clicking the "Add" button.
[Edit]: To edit a todo item, click on the item you want to modify, and the task name becomes editable. Make your changes and press Enter to save them.
[Delete]: Remove unwanted tasks by clicking the delete icon next to each todo item.

2. [Mark Tasks as Completed]: For each task, you can mark it as "completed" by checking the checkbox next to it.
3. [Separate Todo and Completed Sections]: The app offers two sections: "Todo" and "Completed". You can toggle between these sections to see your unfinished tasks and those you've already completed.
4. [Managing Completed Tasks]: In the "Completed" section, you can review the tasks you've marked as completed. You have the option to delete items that you no longer need.

If you mistakenly marked a task as completed, you can easily move it back to the "Todo" list by clicking the undo icon next to that task.

5. [Remove All Tasks]: You can clear all tasks from both the "Todo" and "Completed" sections with the "Remove All" button. Use this with caution as it will delete all items in the respective section.
6. [Persistent Data]: The TodoList uses local storage to store your tasks. This means that even if you refresh the page or close your browser, your tasks will still be available when you return.
